# World Health Statistics 2023 Analysis

- The World Health Statistics Report is the annual compilation of health and health-related indicators which has been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2005. WHO’s Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact produces this report in collaboration with WHO technical departments, and regional and country offices. 
- The 2023 edition reviews more than 50 health-related indicators from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 13). 

## Objectives:
- To highlight differences in health outcomes (life expectancy, disease burden, mortality rates) across regions and income groups.
- Visualize trends to see how global health has improved or declined in specific areas (e.g., infectious disease rates, child mortality, access to healthcare).
- To provide insights into which countries or regions may need more attention and resources based on the data we have received.

## Proposed database
The data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) contains a wide range of global health statistics, so we decomposed these excel sheets into different tables as shown in the ER diagram below for better analysis:

## Insights we hope to address
1. Analyze how life expectancy varies by region or income level.
2. Which regions have the highest maternal and infant rates for example, and try to see if they have improved over time?
3. What diseases are most prevalent in certain countries or regions? How do disease rates (like malaria or tuberculosis) differ between different countries?
4. Which regions have the highest levels of access, and how does it correlate with disease prevalence? There is a column on WASH programs there. This could be useful to see how such programs affect disease prevalence.
5. We can investigate how health outcomes differ between men and women, particularly in areas like life expectancy, reproductive health, and disease prevalence.
