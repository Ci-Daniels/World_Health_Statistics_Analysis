# World Health Statistics 2023 Analysis
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c75ee8b8-3acc-4ff5-8636-2d04360758d9)
- The World Health Statistics Report is the annual compilation of health and health-related indicators which has been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2005. WHO’s Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact produces this report in collaboration with WHO technical departments, and regional and country offices. 
- The 2023 edition reviews more than 50 health-related indicators from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 13). 

## Key Health Indicators

- The 2023 report reviewed more than 50 health indicators from the SDG. We focused our work on the following 6 indicators:

## Objectives:

- To highlight differences in health outcomes (life expectancy, disease burden, mortality rates) across regions.
- Visualize global health compares between the different regionse.g., non-communicable diseases rates, child and maternal mortality, access to healthcare and health workforce).
- To provide insights into which countries or regions may need more attention and resources based on the data we have received.
- Visualize the trends in adolescent birth rates per region.

## Proposed database

The data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) contains a wide range of global health statistics, so we decomposed these Excel sheets into different tables as shown in the ER diagram below for better analysis:

## Visualizations

1. Healthcare access - Analyzed the distribution of healthcare workforce and resources across the region per country

2. Mortality rates - Investigated maternal and child mortality rates across regions and ways to mitigate them.

3. Disease Exposure - Investigated the risk of communicable diseases across regions. This includes malaria, TB, and HIV incidences.

4. Economic Factors - Explored how infrastructure differences affect healthcare services, i.e., universal health coverage and health aid per region.

5. Adolescent birth rate trends - Explored adolescent birth rate trends between 2000 - 2020

## Summary

1. Decline in early marriages - The proportion of African girls married before age 18 has declined from 42% to 34% over the past decade, showing that efforts to end child marriage are having a positive effect on adolescent birth rates.
2. Child mortality rates - While neonatal deaths are a concern, Africa’s under-five mortality is compounded by low immunization coverage. WHO data shows that millions of children in Africa miss routine immunizations due to logistical barriers
3.  Health Aid vs Universal Health Coverage (UHC) - The relationship between health aid and UHC highlights a critical issue: while aid provides temporary relief for targeted issues, such as infectious disease outbreaks, it does not replace the need for comprehensive, systemic healthcare reforms to achieve health coverage.

# Conclusion
1. Africa receives significant international health aid, often targeted at communicable diseases, maternal and child health, and immunization campaigns. However, this aid may not address long-term, systemic improvements in healthcare infrastructure and universal healthcare systems.
2. The healthcare workforce density (doctors, nurses per capita) is much lower in the African region, contributing to its low UHC. Even with substantial health aid, countries with insufficient healthcare personnel cannot provide universal health services, leading to gaps in healthcare access.
3. Despite high levels of external health aid, the African region has the lowest UHC index globally, as health aid is often targeted and short-term. In contrast, many African countries have underfunded national health systems.
4. Africa, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, has one of the highest rates of adolescent births for girls aged 10-14 globally, driven by factors like cultural norms, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare.
